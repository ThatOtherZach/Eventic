**Buy the ticket. Take the ride.**

## But... Why?

I hate Ticketmaster. Those parasitic fees. The endless spam. All for a lousy PDF that costs more in "convenience charges" than actual convenience.

Eventbrite? A spreadsheet with delusions of grandeur, skimming 10% to generate the world's most boring tickets.

These companies are digital toll collectors at the gates of fun. Gatekeepers nobody asked for. So here's my silly solution, Evantic!

This is a one man show and project, some help would be nice. Also, totally beta software so watch your cornhole. [Read the wiki here](https://github.com/ThatOtherZach/Eventic/wiki) for more.

## üéü Tickets That Don't Suck

Your ticket can glow golden. It can transform based on the day, the month, your birthday, or other random chaos.

Drop custom stickers on tickets. Enable peer-to-peer validation for your underground warehouse rave. Lock tickets to GPS coordinates for that secret rooftop show. Enable voting for your anarcho-syndicated commune's bi-weekly internal affairs meeting.

This isn't just ticketing, it's digital metaphysical alchemy! Yes, I'm being serious. No I'm not drunk, stop asking.

## ‚è≥ The 69-Day Rule

Most moments are meant to fade. Event and ticket data self-destructs 69 days after your event ends. A minimal archive survives up to a year, then vanishes too.

Until I ship the NFT feature. $2.69 turns your ticket into an eternal proof-of-experience. Optional. Zero pressure. Proof. You. Were. There. Stuck in the blockchain forever. Or until the world ends. Whichever comes first.

## üé¢ The 69-Day Reputation Window

Only events from the last 69 days count toward your score. Your reputation is always based on what you've done lately, not what you did last year. Think of it like a rolling average of your recent vibe.

Your badge evolves in real-time: NPC ‚Üí Interesting ‚Üí Nice ‚Üí üòé. But slack off, and you'll slide right back down.

## üí∏ The Credits Game (Yes, It's a Game)

We built an entire economy around... wait for it... being nice. I know, revolutionary.

**Credits are NOT tickets.** Credits are like arcade tokens for creating events. Tickets are what people use to actually show up. Everyone starts with 10 credits. You spend them to create events (100-person event = 100 credits). But attending? Always free.

Rate an event with a thumbs up? Boom, you earn 1 credit. Want to thumbs down that terrible DJ set? That'll cost you 1 credit. Because negativity should cost something, even if it's tiny.

## üé≠ The Absurdist Social Experiment

With P2P validation, you can create events for literally anything. "Standing in this parking lot for 10 minutes." "Synchronized yelling at the moon." "Being alive on a Tuesday." 

Everything vanishes after 69 days. But minted tickets? They're forever. A permanent record that yes, you were there when 47 strangers decided to have a staring contest in a Denny's parking lot at 3am. Was it stupid? Absolutely. Was it real? The blockchain says yes.

## ‚ú® The Philosophy

No engagement metrics. No influencer tiers. No algorithmic manipulation. Just tickets to things that actually happen. In places that actually exist. For people who actually show up.

We built this for the underground comedy show. The warehouse rave. The popup restaurant. The anarchist book club. The rooftop ritual. Things that matter because they don't last forever.

## üèÅ The Promise

Create weird events. Validate real moments. Let most things disappear. And when something truly matters? Mint it.

This is Evantic. We're not disrupting anything. We're not the future of anything. We're just making tickets that don't suck.
