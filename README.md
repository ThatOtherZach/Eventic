**Buy the ticket. Take the ride.**

## But... Why?

I hate Ticketmaster. Parasitic fees, endless spam and all for a lousy PDF that costs more in "convenience charges" than actual convenience.

Eventbrite? A spreadsheet with delusions of grandeur, skimming 10% to generate the world's most boring tickets.

These companies are digital toll collectors at the gates of fun. Gatekeepers nobody asked for. So here's my silly solution, Eventic!

Here there be dragons. This is a beta and lord knows there's bugs around here somewhere. I'm just a one man show at the moment, so if you find something wacky weird, please fly over to Github and report it. Otherwise I'll never know. [Read the wiki here](https://github.com/ThatOtherZach/Eventic/wiki) for a game guide / user manual.

## üéü Tickets That Don't Suck

Now your ticket can glow golden. It can transform based on the day, the month, your birthday, or other random chaos.

Drop custom stickers on tickets. Enable peer-to-peer validation for your underground warehouse rave. Lock tickets to GPS coordinates for that secret rooftop show. Enable voting for your anarcho-syndicated commune's bi-weekly internal affairs meeting.

This isn't just ticketing, it's digital metaphysical alchemy! Yes, I'm being serious. No I'm not drunk, stop asking.

## ‚è≥ 69-Day Data Retention 

Most moments are meant to fade. Event and ticket data self-destructs 69 days after your event ends. A minimal archive survives up to a year, then vanishes too.

Want to keep it long term? For just $2.69 you can mint your ticket into an eternal proof-of-experience digital collectable. Totally optional. Zero pressure. We store the anchor point for your collectable and you're free to take it where evever the blockchain takes you.

## üé¢ Reputation Decay
Only events from the last 69 days count toward your score. Run an amazing event today? Those thumbs up boost your rep immediately. But in 69 days? Poof, they fall off. Your reputation is always based on what you've done lately, not what you did last year.

Think of it like a rolling average of your recent vibe. Got 100 thumbs up from an event 68 days ago? Tomorrow you'll need fresh ones to maintain your status. Your badge evolves in real-time: NPC ‚Üí Interesting ‚Üí Nice ‚Üí üòé.

This revolving door reputation system means bad events can't haunt you forever as redemption is always 69 days away. You can't coast on past glory‚Äîstay active or fade away. Gaming the system is pointless since the ratings expire with the events.

It's reputation with an expiration date. Fresh, organic, and impossible to hoard.

## üí∏ The Ticket Economy

OK, so here's where it gets weird (in a good way). Eventic has an entire economy around... wait for it... being nice! I know, revolutionary.

Tickets for all users are like arcade tokens, they're used for interacting with the platform for actions like creating events. So an event with 50 attendees will cost you 50 tickets. Tickets are what people use to actually show up. Got it? Good. Everyone starts with 10 tickets as a signup bonus. You spend them to create events, boost to the featured section of the home page as well as increase odds of getting specials effects applied. RVSP'ing to an event is always free (so long as there's tickets available). If the event organizer has applied a ticket price, you'll pay at the door on with our payment options.

Here's the fun part: Rate an event with a thumbs up? Boom, you earn 1 ticket. First time only though‚Äîwe're not running a credit farm here. Want to thumbs down that terrible DJ set? That'll cost you 1 ticket. Why? Because negativity should cost something, even if it's tiny.

Changed your mind? Switching your rating is free. We're not monsters.

Event ticket payments happens at the door. Venmo in the DMs. Crypto in the metaverse. Whatever. We don't touch it. We're just the matchmaker between people who throw parties and people who show up to them.

We do allow event creators to add crypto payments, but we don't touch any of those funds, creators keep 100% of their ticket revenue.

## üé≠ The Absurdist Social Experiment

Here's the beautiful, chaotic part: With P2P validation, you can create events for literally anything. "Standing in this parking lot for 10 minutes." "Synchronized yelling at the moon." "Being alive on a Tuesday." Turn it on and everyone who shows up can validate each other. No gatekeepers. Pure chaos.

The kicker? These ridiculous moments can become permanent. That ticket from "Emergency dance party in Steve's backyard because his ex got engaged"? That proof you were at "The great pillow fight of 2025"? Mint it as an digital collectable and keep it forever.

Everything else vanishes after 69 days unless you mint it as a digital collectable. A permanent record that yes, you were there when 47 strangers decided to have a staring contest in a Denny's parking lot at 3am. Was it stupid? Absolutely. Can you prove it for years to come? Yup.

This isn't about creating value. It's about proving existence. "I was there" becomes immutable truth. Even if "there" was completely absurd.

## ‚ú® The Philosophy

No engagement metrics. No influencer tiers. No algorithmic manipulation. Just tickets to things that actually happen. In places that actually exist. For people who actually show up.

We built this for the underground comedy show. The warehouse rave. The popup restaurant. The anarchist book club. The rooftop ritual. Things that matter because they don't last forever.

## üèÅ The Promise

Create weird events. Validate real moments. Let most things disappear. And when something truly matters? Mint it.

This is Evantic. We're not disrupting anything. We're not the future of anything. We're just making tickets that don't suck.
