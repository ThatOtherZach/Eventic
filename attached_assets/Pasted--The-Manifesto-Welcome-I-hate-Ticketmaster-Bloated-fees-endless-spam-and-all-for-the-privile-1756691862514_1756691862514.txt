🎭 The Manifesto

Welcome.

I hate Ticketmaster. Bloated fees, endless spam, and all for the privilege of a lousy PDF. Eventbrite isn’t much better — a boring event manager that somehow skims 10% just to be a glorified PDF generator. These companies are nothing but digital toll booths at the gates of fun.

That’s lame. So I built Eventic.

🎟 Tickets, But Actually Fun

Eventic makes ticketing weird again.

Tickets can glow golden, sprout emojis on the right day, or burst into confetti.

Organizers can drop custom GIFs or stickers right on top.

You can turn a ticket into a multi-use pass, lock it to a GPS circle, or flip on peer-to-peer mode where anyone can validate anyone else’s ticket. Perfect for flash mobs, rooftop rituals, or anarcho-syndicalist communes.

Anyone can create an event. You only pay for tickets, sold in packs. New users get 10 free to start, plus a tiny daily drop (2–4) when you log in. Tickets are the only currency — spend them to host events or boost them into the spotlight.

🔐 Security, Chaos, Control

Validation system: works in any browser.

Geofence: lock tickets to a specific location, 690m radius.

Passes: allow multiple entries with a toggle.

Surge pricing: one checkbox, prices rise when demand spikes.

⏳ The 69-Day Fuse

Here’s the law of the land: event and ticket data self-destructs 69 days after the event ends. A barebones archive survives for a year, then it too is gone.

Unless you mint it. For $2.69, your ticket becomes a permanent NFT artifact — your proof-of-experience, locked forever. Optional, always optional.

✨ Ephemeral by Design

At Eventic we know most events fade — and that’s the point. Some deserve to survive, most don’t. Collectibles are an optional add-on. Organizers can enable it, ticket holders can choose it. No one is forced. If you want it, keep it. If not, it vaporizes in 69 days.

🏁 The Ethos

No likes. No algorithms. No clout-chasing. Just a silly ticket to prove you showed up, to remember the moment — or let it disappear.

Buy the ticket. Validate the ride. Collect the moment before it burns away.
