          <p className="mb-3">
            It started like all great revolutions do‚Äîwith edibles, craft beer, and the creeping dread of rejection emails piling up like parking tickets on a dead man‚Äôs car. I woke up sweating, buzzing, half-convinced I was being chased through the desert by the ghost of Steve Jobs. Somewhere in that chemical afterglow, I muttered the words that would change everything: ‚ÄúTo hell with this. I‚Äôm building my own circus.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            And in that moment of divine inspiration (or THC-induced clarity), I decided to take on 
            the final boss of the ticketing world: Ticketmaster. Yeah, THAT Ticketmaster. The one 
            with the fees that cost more than your actual ticket. The one that crashes every time 
            Taylor Swift announces a tour.
          </p>
          <p>
            So here it is, folks. My magnum opus. My middle finger to the establishment. 
            An event ticketing platform where tickets get golden, effects get special, and 
            sometimes your event just keeps coming back like that friend who "forgot" their wallet. 
            This is where event creators become legends and ticket holders get treated like actual humans.

              Remember Willy Wonka? Yeah, it's like that but without the chocolate river. 
              Enable this bad boy and 10% of your validated tickets turn GOLDEN. That's right, 
              actual digital gold (not redeemable for real gold, we checked). Winners get that 
              sweet, sweet golden glow that says "I'm special" without actually saying it.
            </p>
            <small className="text-muted">
              Pro tip: If someone gets both golden AND rainbow effects, they become DOUBLE GOLDEN. 
              It's like winning the lottery twice, but cooler.

              Turn your boring tickets into a Michael Bay movie! When enabled, validated tickets 
              get random visual effects based on super secret conditions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Confetti:</strong> For birthdays and New Year's - because who doesn't love digital confetti?</li>
              <li><strong>Hearts:</strong> Valentine's Day special - spread the love, literally</li>
              <li><strong>Spooky Ghosts:</strong> Halloween vibes with floating üëª emojis</li>
              <li><strong>Christmas Magic:</strong> Santa, trees, and snow for the festive season</li>
              <li><strong>Fireworks:</strong> 4th of July explosions (no fingers were harmed)</li>
              <li><strong>Pride Rainbow:</strong> June pride month with fabulous gradients</li>
              <li><strong>Monthly Colors:</strong> Each month gets its own special color theme</li>
              <li><strong>"Nice" Effect:</strong> Events on the 1st get this... nice surprise</li>

            <p>
              Like your favorite ride-sharing app, but for events! Set a multiplier (1.5x to 5x) 
              and watch prices go brrrr when tickets start flying off the digital shelves. 
              Kicks in when you hit 50% capacity because supply and demand is real, folks.

              Got a weekly poker night? Monthly book club? Annual "definitely-not-a-cult" meeting? 
              Set it to recur and your event resurrects itself like a phoenix after it ends:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Every 7 days, like clockwork</li>

              <li><strong>Annually:</strong> Once a year, for those special occasions</li>
            </ul>
            <small className="text-muted">

              Upload a sticker URL and set the odds (1-100%). When tickets get validated, 
              BAM! Your custom sticker might float around like a beautiful butterfly. 
              Or a pizza. Or your ex's face. We don't judge.

              Democracy comes to ticket validation! Enable this and ANY ticket holder can 
              validate other tickets. It's like deputizing everyone at your event. 
              Perfect for flash mobs, raves, or events where you "might not make it" (we see you).

            The Validator: PIN Code Power

          <p className="mb-3">
            Forget QR codes - we're keeping it simple with good old PIN codes. 
            The validator is your gateway to checking tickets at the door. 
            Navigate to <Link href="/scanner"><a className="text-primary">the validator page</a></Link> and 
            become the gatekeeper of your event.

          <h5>How PIN Validation Works:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Ticket holders get a PIN</strong> - When someone views their ticket, they can generate 
              a 6-digit validation PIN that's good for 5 minutes. It's like a secret handshake, but with numbers.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Open the validator</strong> - Click "Validate" in the navigation (the checkmark icon)
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Enter the PIN</strong> - Type in that 6-digit code the ticket holder shows you
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Watch the magic happen</strong> - Valid ticket? ‚úÖ Special effects might appear! 
              Invalid, expired, or already used? ‚ùå No entry for you!
            </li>
          </ol>

              <li>Once validated, the ticket is marked as used forever</li>
