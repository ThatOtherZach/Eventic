          <p className="mb-3">
            I hate Ticketmaster. Bloated fees, endless spam, and all for the privilege of a lousy PDF. Eventbrite isn't much better ‚Äî a boring event manager that somehow skims 10% just to be a glorified PDF generator. These companies are nothing but digital toll booths at the gates of fun.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            That's lame. So I built Eventic.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Eventic makes ticketing weird again.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Tickets can glow golden, sprout emojis on the right day, or burst into confetti.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Organizers can drop custom GIFs or stickers right on top.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            You can turn a ticket into a multi-use pass, lock it to a GPS circle, or flip on peer-to-peer mode where anyone can validate anyone else's ticket. Perfect for flash mobs, rooftop rituals, or anarcho-syndicalist communes.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Anyone can create an event. You only pay for tickets, sold in packs. New users get 10 free to start, plus a tiny daily drop (2‚Äì4) when you log in. Tickets are the only currency ‚Äî spend them to host events or boost them into the spotlight.

          <p className="mb-3">
            Here's the law of the land: event and ticket data self-destructs 69 days after the event ends. A barebones archive survives for a year, then it too is gone.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Unless you mint it. For $2.69, your ticket becomes a permanent NFT artifact ‚Äî your proof-of-experience, locked forever. Optional, always optional.

          <h5 className="mt-4 mb-3">‚ú® Ephemeral by Design</h5>
          <p className="mb-3">
            At Eventic we know most events fade ‚Äî and that's the point. Some deserve to survive, most don't. Collectibles are an optional add-on. Organizers can enable it, ticket holders can choose it. No one is forced. If you want it, keep it. If not, it vaporizes in 69 days.

              Remember Willy Wonka? Yeah, it's like that but without the chocolate river. 
              Enable this bad boy and 10% of your validated tickets turn GOLDEN. That's right, 
              actual digital gold (not redeemable for real gold, we checked). Winners get that 
              sweet, sweet golden glow that says "I'm special" without actually saying it.
            </p>
            <small className="text-muted">
              Pro tip: If someone gets both golden AND rainbow effects, they become DOUBLE GOLDEN. 
              It's like winning the lottery twice, but cooler.

            <p>
              Turn your boring tickets into a Michael Bay movie! When enabled, validated tickets 
              get random visual effects based on super secret conditions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Confetti:</strong> For birthdays and New Year's - because who doesn't love digital confetti?</li>
              <li><strong>Hearts:</strong> Valentine's Day special - spread the love, literally</li>
              <li><strong>Spooky Ghosts:</strong> Halloween vibes with floating üëª emojis</li>
              <li><strong>Christmas Magic:</strong> Santa, trees, and snow for the festive season</li>
              <li><strong>Fireworks:</strong> 4th of July explosions (no fingers were harmed)</li>
              <li><strong>Pride Rainbow:</strong> June pride month with fabulous gradients</li>
              <li><strong>Monthly Colors:</strong> Each month gets its own special color theme</li>
              <li><strong>"Nice" Effect:</strong> Events on the 1st get this... nice surprise</li>

            <p>
              Like your favorite ride-sharing app, but for events! Set a multiplier (1.5x to 5x) 
              and watch prices go brrrr when tickets start flying off the digital shelves. 
              Kicks in when you hit 50% capacity because supply and demand is real, folks.

              Got a weekly poker night? Monthly book club? Annual "definitely-not-a-cult" meeting? 
              Set it to recur and your event resurrects itself like a phoenix after it ends:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Every 7 days, like clockwork</li>

              <li><strong>Annually:</strong> Once a year, for those special occasions</li>
            </ul>
            <small className="text-muted">

            <p>
              Upload a sticker URL and set the odds (1-100%). When tickets get validated, 
              BAM! Your custom sticker might float around like a beautiful butterfly. 
              Or a pizza. Or your ex's face. We don't judge.

              Democracy comes to ticket validation! Enable this and ANY ticket holder can 
              validate other tickets. It's like deputizing everyone at your event. 
              Perfect for flash mobs, raves, or events where you "might not make it" (we see you).

          <p className="mb-3">
            Forget QR codes - we're keeping it simple with good old PIN codes.

          <ol>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Ticket holders get a PIN</strong> - When someone views their ticket, they can generate 
              a 6-digit validation PIN that's good for 5 minutes. It's like a secret handshake, but with numbers.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Open the validator</strong> - Click "Validate" in the navigation (the checkmark icon)
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Enter the PIN</strong> - Type in that 6-digit code the ticket holder shows you
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Watch the magic happen</strong> - Valid ticket? ‚úÖ Special effects might appear! 
              Invalid, expired, or already used? ‚ùå No entry for you!
            </li>
          </ol>

              <li>PINs expire after 5 minutes (keeps things secure)</li>
              <li>Each ticket can generate unlimited PINs (until it's validated)</li>
              <li>Once validated, the ticket is marked as used forever</li>
