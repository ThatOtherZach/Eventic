          <p>
            Welcome to the ultimate event management playground where tickets get golden, 
            effects get special, and sometimes your event just keeps coming back like that 
            friend who "forgot" their wallet. This is where event creators become legends 
            and ticket holders become... well, ticket holders with really cool effects.

            <p>
              Remember Willy Wonka? Yeah, it's like that but without the chocolate river. 
              Enable this bad boy and 10% of your validated tickets turn GOLDEN. That's right, 
              actual digital gold (not redeemable for real gold, we checked). Winners get that 
              sweet, sweet golden glow that says "I'm special" without actually saying it.
            </p>
            <small className="text-muted">
              Pro tip: If someone gets both golden AND rainbow effects, they become DOUBLE GOLDEN. 
              It's like winning the lottery twice, but cooler.

          <div className="mb-4">

            <p>
              Turn your boring tickets into a Michael Bay movie! When enabled, validated tickets 
              get random visual effects based on super secret conditions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Confetti:</strong> For birthdays and New Year's - because who doesn't love digital confetti?</li>
              <li><strong>Hearts:</strong> Valentine's Day special - spread the love, literally</li>
              <li><strong>Spooky Ghosts:</strong> Halloween vibes with floating üëª emojis</li>
              <li><strong>Christmas Magic:</strong> Santa, trees, and snow for the festive season</li>
              <li><strong>Fireworks:</strong> 4th of July explosions (no fingers were harmed)</li>
              <li><strong>Pride Rainbow:</strong> June pride month with fabulous gradients</li>
              <li><strong>Monthly Colors:</strong> Each month gets its own special color theme</li>
              <li><strong>"Nice" Effect:</strong> Events on the 1st get this... nice surprise</li>
            </ul>
            <small className="text-muted">
              Effects are permanent once assigned - no take-backsies!

          <div className="mb-4">
            <h5 className="text-danger">üìà Surge Pricing</h5>
            <p>
              Like your favorite ride-sharing app, but for events! Set a multiplier (1.5x to 5x) 
              and watch prices go brrrr when tickets start flying off the digital shelves. 
              Kicks in when you hit 50% capacity because supply and demand is real, folks.

            <p>
              Got a weekly poker night? Monthly book club? Annual "definitely-not-a-cult" meeting? 
              Set it to recur and your event resurrects itself like a phoenix after it ends:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Every 7 days, like clockwork</li>
              <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> Same date each month (or closest valid date)</li>
              <li><strong>Annually:</strong> Once a year, for those special occasions</li>
            </ul>

          <div className="mb-4">
            <h5 className="text-pink">üé® Custom Stickers</h5>
            <p>
              Upload a sticker URL and set the odds (1-100%). When tickets get validated, 
              BAM! Your custom sticker might float around like a beautiful butterfly. 
              Or a pizza. Or your ex's face. We don't judge.

            <p>
              Democracy comes to ticket validation! Enable this and ANY ticket holder can 
              validate other tickets. It's like deputizing everyone at your event. 
              Perfect for flash mobs, raves, or events where you "might not make it" (we see you).
