### Ticket Resale System (Added January 2025)
- **Replaces Refund System**: Tickets can no longer be refunded, but can be listed for resale to other users
- **Price Enforcement**: Tickets can only be resold at their original purchase price - no markup allowed
- **Platform Fee**: 2% transaction fee is charged on resell transactions for paid tickets only
- **Free Ticket Returns**: Tickets purchased for $0.00 can be "returned" without any platform fee - they become immediately available for others
- **Resale Queue Management**: Tickets listed for resale are queued in order, with the first listed having priority for new purchases
- **Automatic Matching**: When users buy tickets for an event, they are automatically matched with the first available resell ticket before creating new tickets
- **Owner Transfer**: Resold tickets transfer from the original owner to the new buyer, with payment going directly to the original owner (minus 2% fee for paid tickets)
- **Database Changes**: Added `resellQueue`, `resellTransactions` tables and `resellStatus`/`originalOwnerId`/`purchasePrice` fields to tickets table
- **API Updates**: Replaced `/api/tickets/:id/refund` endpoint with `/api/tickets/:id/resell` endpoint
- **UI Changes**: Shows "Return" button for free tickets and "Resell" for paid tickets, with appropriate messaging for each

### Error Logging System (Added August 2025)
- **Comprehensive System Logging**: All server errors are automatically logged to a `system_logs` table with detailed context including stack traces, user information, and request metadata
- **90-Day Retention Policy**: Logs are automatically cleaned up after 90 days to manage storage
- **Error Classification**: System distinguishes between user errors (400-499 status codes) and system faults (500+ status codes, network failures)
- **Logging Levels**: Three severity levels - `error` for system faults, `warning` for validation issues, and `info` for important operations
- **API Access**: System logs can be accessed via `/api/system-logs` endpoint for monitoring and debugging

### Bootstrap-Style Toast Notifications (Added August 2025)
- **Visual Feedback**: Three toast variants matching Bootstrap styling:
  - Success (green with checkmark âœ“): For successful operations
  - Error (red with X icon âœ—): For user errors and validation failures  
  - System Fault (yellow with alert icon âš ): For server/system errors with "System Fault Detected:" prefix
- **Automatic Dismissal**: Toasts auto-dismiss after 4 seconds for success/error, 6 seconds for system faults
- **Consistent UX**: All user interactions provide immediate visual feedback through toast notifications

### Enhanced Event Management (Added August 2025)
- **Date/Time Validation**: Events now have "Starts on" and "Ends on" fields with validation ensuring end time comes after start time
- **Multi-Day Events**: Support for events spanning multiple days with proper date/time handling
- **Improved Error Messages**: User-friendly error messages with clear guidance on what went wrong

### Production Readiness Optimizations (January 2025)
- **Date Handling Robustness**: Fixed "Invalid time value" errors by adding proper date validation and error handling throughout the application
- **Authentication Resilience**: Improved JWKS verification to handle connectivity issues gracefully without breaking authentication
- **Error Logging Enhancement**: Enhanced error messages with better context and specific error details for debugging
- **Schema Optimization**: Added proper types for user reputation cache system with hourly update capability
- **Rate Limiting**: Comprehensive rate limiting on ticket purchases (3/min) and event creation (2/5min) with detailed logging
- **Input Validation**: Robust Zod validation schemas with comprehensive regex patterns for data integrity
- **Performance**: Implemented reputation caching system to reduce database load during high traffic

### Venue Address System (Added January 2025)
- **Separate Address Fields**: Venue creation now uses three separate fields: Street Address, City, and Country
- **Country Dropdown**: Country field provides a complete dropdown list of all valid countries for consistent data entry
- **Smart Parsing**: When editing existing events, the venue string is intelligently parsed to populate the three fields
- **Validation**: At least one address field must be filled when creating or editing an event
- **Automatic Combination**: The three fields automatically combine into a single venue string for storage (e.g., "123 Main St, New York, United States")
- **Auto Location Updates**: User location field automatically updates with countries from their latest 3 events only when:
  - User creates a new event
  - User purchases a ticket (new or resell)
- **"None" Protection**: If user explicitly sets location to "None", the system won't auto-update their location
- **Location-Based Event Filtering**: Events on home page are filtered by user's location countries:
  - If location is "None" or blank: Shows all public events globally
  - If location has countries: Only shows events in those specific countries
  - Applies to regular events list, featured events, and featured grid

## System Architecture
